# setup4bmatotp

This desktop app helps setting up a totp app to use as a second factor authenticor for blizzard.

This project heavily depends [python-bna](https://github.com/jleclanche/python-bna/) and heavily boroughs code from it.

Atm you need to be on the flutter master channel to build flutter apps for desktop.

If you want to deploy this to web or mobile, there is nothing this readme can do to stop you.

## Warning: this application does not save any date and this is unable to recover an authenticator created with it. Please make use of the restore code shown.
