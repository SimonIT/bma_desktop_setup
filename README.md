# setup4bmatotp

This desktop app helps setting up a TOTP-app to use as a second-factor authenticator for Blizzard.

## Warning: this application does not save any data and thus is unable to recover an authenticator created with it. Unless a restore code is used.

This project heavily depends on [python-bna](https://github.com/jleclanche/python-bna/) and heavily borrows code from it (although this project does not run any python code).

At the moment, you need to be on the flutter master channel to build flutter apps for desktop.

If you want to deploy this to the web or mobile, there is nothing this readme can do to stop you.

This application is not associated in any way with Blizzard Entertainment Inc.
